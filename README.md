# Hello World!

This is a Hello World program written in Python.

Unfortunately writing cross-platform programs in a high-level language
is really difficult, so this program doesn't work on Windows.

If you're using Windows or you don't like "Hello World" programs, you
can also try `wololo.py`. It's cross-platform, but it requires Python
3.6 or newer.
